Installation
------------

From pip: pip install git+https://github.com/CUBoulder-OIT/cupyopt.git@master#egg=cupyopt

Alternatively, and importantly for development, clone this into an existing project and install in "development mode" with -e.

git clone https://github.com/CUBoulder-OIT/cupyopt.git
pip install -e cupyopt/

NB, The 'x' and 'y' (lately 0.12) in the versioning matches the versioning in Prefect. However the 'z' is ours and is not guaranteed to match up with the 'z' in Prefect.

Use

Import the Task you need similar to,

from cupyopt import SFTPGet, ORADBGetEngine
